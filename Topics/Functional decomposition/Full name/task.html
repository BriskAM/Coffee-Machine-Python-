<h2>Full name</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p></p>
<p>In the code below, you can see a program that creates a full name from the first and last names for several people. </p>
<pre><code class="language-python">name1 = "John"
last_name1 = "Lennon"
full_name1 = name1 + " " + last_name1
        
name2 = "Hermione"
last_name2 = "Granger"
full_name2 = name2 + " " + last_name2</code></pre>
<p>Wouldn't it be much easier if we had a function that could do the same?</p>
<p>Your task is to write the body of the function <code class="language-python">create_full_name</code> that takes <code class="language-python">name</code> and <code class="language-python">last_name</code> (in this order) and <strong>returns</strong> the full name. </p>
<p>Do NOT change the variable names. You don't need to call the function yourself. </p><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 15 seconds</font><br><br>
